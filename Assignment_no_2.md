Sure! Here are the short notes on each topic:

- **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
  
- **SDK (Software Development Kit):** A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build applications for a specific platform or service.

- **Web APIs:** APIs that allow communication between web-based systems, typically using HTTP to enable integration and data exchange over the internet.

- **Library APIs:** A set of functions and routines provided by a software library, enabling applications to perform specific tasks without needing to write low-level code.

- **Prompting and Completion:** In AI models, **prompting** involves providing a model with input (prompt) to generate output, and **completion** refers to the modelâ€™s generated response to that input.
