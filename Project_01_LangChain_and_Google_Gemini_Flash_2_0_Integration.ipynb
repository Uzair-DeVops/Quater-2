Instead of just analyzing existing data, it learns patterns and structures from that data and then uses that knowledge to create something entirely new. Think of it like this:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Traditional AI:** Learns to recognize a cat in a picture.\n",
            "* **Generative AI:** Learns what makes a cat a cat and then draws a completely new picture of a cat.\n",
